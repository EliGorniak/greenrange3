### Description

Green Range is a web application created to make the user's cooking time easier.

Currently, there is an abundance of meal kit delivery services on the market that send quality meals to be prepared at home. Each of these services send their meals in individual boxes with multiple plastic bags, cooler packs, and other forms of packaging destined for the recycling, or worse, the dump.

Recent studies show that up to 90% of plastic that hits a recycling plant doesn’t actually get recycled and instead sits in a landfill for generations. 

Green Range sends the same quality meals with recipes inspired by internationally acclaimed chefs, and does it without all of the unnecessary packaging. 

By sending all of the ingredients straight to client from his favorite grocery store, instead of from a warehouse where a staff with large overhead labor costs prep some of the food before it’s shipped, Green Range can do it for less money than other competitors.

### How it works

1. To use the app, the user needs to sign up. All the user's informations goes to a database.
2. After signing up the user will be able to choose a weekly meal plan, with recipes designed by world renowned chefs. 
3. Then, all the ingredients needed to make these meals will be added to a shopping cart. The ingredients will then be delivered from Walmart to the user.
4. Each week the app will provide new recipes to set a new weekly meal plans.
